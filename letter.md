I have an awkward question This poem's short a letter and, because my gaze is weak,

has proven weak
despite my zeal and ___,


earnest plea,

I cannot seem to find it.
Would you mind helping me?

this prose was nixed a letter yet despite my watchful eye/gaze


someone mixed up the letters in my alphabet-wise prose!
and i seem to have mis placed one, could you help out my nose?


I _____ed and ____ed. I searched and stared. I scanned and scrutinized.     ///I've studied and explored.
and still my gaze has proven quite the failure of my eyes.

because a letter's missing from this ____ing of a plea
and I cannot seem to find it, would you mind helping me?


this verse is short a letter yet depite my earnest plea,
i cannot seem to find it, would you mind helping me?

I surveyed the many letters in this poem, though it's short    thoughn instead of but               // explored/surveyed
but my gaze can't seem to find all twenty-six, think you could help?
